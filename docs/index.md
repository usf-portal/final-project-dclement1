# World War II Bombing Mission -- SQL Relational Database

	    This project is an attempt to create a relational database of the World War II bombing missions dataset. Some digital humanities projects have already been done with this dataset; however none of them take advantage of the usefulness of relational databases. Therefore, I believe the creation of this database will allow an increased ease of access, as well an increase in the ability of digital humanists to study this dataset in ways not previously possible.
