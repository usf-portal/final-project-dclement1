# Roadblocks

    This dataset is fairly large and cumbersome to work with, however, luckily it was already decent in terms of formatting and standardization. This topic is one which is very important in digital humanities, as inconsistencies in a dataset can lead to major issues and headaches in the future. One example of this could be for instance, if you had one column which listed what country each mission was flown from, and some entries had "France" and some others said "france" or "FR". This will cause major issues, as when attempting to query the data and ask questions about it, you will not be receiving accurate counts as certain entries will be emitted.

    One issue I did have with this dataset however, was incomplete data. Many columns had incomplete data, with a lot of missions having blank fields. This, while not a huge issue is still something you want to consider, when thinking about how your data can affect and altar your analysis and conclusions. Digital humanities techniques make use of technologies that allow researchers to perform monumental feats of data processing and analysis, with relatively little effort compared to in the past. However, there are also some pitfalls which can lead to issues if not careful.
