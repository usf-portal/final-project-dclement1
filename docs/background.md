# Background and Purpose
    This dataset was completely new to me, and was found online while searching for historical datasets. This dataset was hosted on a website, www.kaggle.com , and was uploaded by the United States Air force. This dataset contains 178,282 missions by allied air forces during World War II. It contains over 43 columns of information, such as units associated with each mission, departure and target geographic coordinates, aircraft left, aircraft returned, aircraft damaged, as well as information on the amount and type of ordinance which was dropped on the target.

    This dataset has certainly been used by others in very interesting digital humanities projects. On Kaggle, the website allows people to post about and share projects where they used the dataset. One of the projects which stood out to me was done by Kevin Mader, and uses a programming language entitled "R" to process the data, and produce various maps of the bombing missions. One very interesting series of maps produced shows the progression of missions over time. This can be seen below.

    Another project, which was done by Shane Smith is entitled "Did Bombing Operations Change on D-Day?". This used Python to process and analyze the WWII bombing dataset. In this project, Smith was able to identify various trends in the bombing missions that took place during D-Day. This project is available here: [https://www.kaggle.com/smid80/did-bombing-operations-change-on-d-day-no-maps](https://www.kaggle.com/smid80/did-bombing-operations-change-on-d-day-no-maps)

    The last project that deals with the WWII bombing dataset, was done by "cswingle", and is entitled "Preliminary look at the data". This project uses the same R language used in the mapping project discussed earlier. In this project, the data is analyzed statistically, and some interesting trends are visible. This project is available at the following address: [https://www.kaggle.com/cswingle/preliminary-look-at-the-data](https://www.kaggle.com/cswingle/preliminary-look-at-the-data)

    These projects would show me the potential that this dataset contains, and would motivate me to create something useful from it. Based on my observations, all of the projects done on this dataset so far, have only ever used the raw spreadsheet version. With the goal of our Digital Humanities II class being the creation of a database, I could see how doing this could lead to increase access and dissemination, as well as an increase in research on the dataset. In the future, I believe that if the database produced in this project can be fine-tuned and tweaked, a very useful, historical dataset will be more easily and readily available for researchers.
