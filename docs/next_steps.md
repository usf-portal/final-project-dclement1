# Next Steps

    The database could be redesigned as there are a couple things which may be able to improve it. For instance, if we were to combine the target table and the Location table into one, We could then simply use a new field in the new table, called "Location_Type". This would then indicate if a location is a target or a departure location. After this, we could create a table entitled country and have a column in this table that is a Country_ID this would allow us to simply include "Country_ID" to any table which includes a country location and have that column relate to the country ID field in the country table. Doing this would allow us to ask questions about specific countries which is not possible in the current design, as every table that includes a country field, has a unique country column such as, Takeoff_Country, Target_Country, Country (Unit Table).

    This project would also benefit from the addition of other complementary datasets. This could be, for instance, a dataset comprised of ground troop operations, with which one could compare and analyze various trends between aerial bombing and ground operations. Also, another logical next step in this project could be to host this database on a site, and allow academic researcher as well as the public to access, explore and analyze the dataset. This would fulfill the goal of the project, which is to increase access and awareness of this dataset, in order to promote new research on the subject.
